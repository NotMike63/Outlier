I want to make a cookie clicking game using one file of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The site needs to have a cookie user's can click to gain more cookies. There have to be workers for sale in the shop that earn passive income, like in the image. For example, users can purchase a cursors that harvest .1 cookies per second for 10 cookies, then a grandma for 100 cookies and so forth. There needs to be at least 5 workers that get more expensive as you buy them. I want the site to have a nostalgic theme like the image, for example using bordered boxes and a gritty textured background.
